# Fast Delete

Windows isn't great at deleting large files or folders with lots of files inside. That is where fast-delete.bat comes in, it provides a simple bat file that you can run, specify the folder path you wish to delete and it'll do so and close out once its done.

****Note:** the files will be deleted permanently and will not be in the recycling bin.

## How does it work?
The commands used to delete the files come from this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/186737/whats-the-fastest-way-to-delete-a-large-folder-in-windows/6208144#6208144) comment.
